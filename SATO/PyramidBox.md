# PyramidBox
<h1>PyramidBox: A Context-assisted Single Shot
Face Detector</h1>

>Task : `Face Detection`

> Improve the utilization of contextual information in the following three
aspects :
> - Design a novel context anchor to supervise high-level
contextual feature learning by a semi-supervised method _(PyramidAnchors)_
> - _*Low-level Feature Pyramid
Network*_  to combine adequate high-level context semantic feature and
Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the PyramidBox to
predict faces of all scales in a single shot.
> - Introduce a contextsensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to improve the final accuracy of output.

> **Method**: Low-level Feature Pyramid
Networks

> **Backbone**: VGG16

> **Metric** : Average precision (Precision-recall curves)

> **Loss** : PyramidBox Loss

> **Dataset** : WIDER FACE
