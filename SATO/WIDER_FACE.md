The WIDER FACE: dataset contains 32,203 images and labels 393,703 faces with a high degree of variability in scale, pose and occlusion. The database is split into training (40%), validation (10%) and testing (50%) set. Besides, the images are divided into three levels (Easy ⊆ Medium ⊆ Hard) according to the difficulties of the detection. The images and annotations of training and validation set are available online, while the annotations of testing set are not released and the results are sent to the database server for receiving the precision-recall curves.
