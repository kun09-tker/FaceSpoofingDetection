# Improving Face Anti-Spoofing by 3D Virtual Synthesis

>**Task** :`Face Anti-Spoofing`, `Face Recognition`

> A method to synthesize virtual spoof data in 3D space. Specifically, we consider a printed photo as a flat surface and mesh it into a 3D object, which is then randomly bent and rotated in 3D space

>**Model** : ResNet-15

> **Metric** : Equal Error Rate (EER): 0.25
Half Total Error Rate (HTER) : 0.63

> **Dataset** : Replay-Attack
