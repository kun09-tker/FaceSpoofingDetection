<h1>FACE ANTI-SPOOFING BASED ON COLOR TEXTURE ANALYSIS</h1>

>**Task** : `Face Anti-Spoofing`, `Texture Classification`

> Both the display medium
dependent color gamut signatures and the local chroma variations (noise) can be described by analyzing the color texture
of the chroma channels. Since the chrominance channels
are separated from the luminance information, they are also
more tolerant to illumination variation assuming that the acquisition conditions are reasonable. 

>**Three type of attacks** :
> - Print attacks
> - Mobile attacks
> - Highdef attacks 

>**Explore texture information** : $YC_bC_r$

>**Discriminative gray-scale** : Local Binary Patterns (LBP)

>**Model** : SVM (Support Vector Machine)

>**Metric** : Equal Error Rate (EER): 0.4

>**Dataset** : Replay-Attack
