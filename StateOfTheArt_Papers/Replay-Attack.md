# Replay-Attack

>The Replay-Attack Database for face spoofing consists of 1300 video clips of photo and video attack attempts to 50 clients, under different lighting conditions. All videos are generated by either having a (real) client trying to access a laptop through a built-in webcam or by displaying a photo or a video recording of the same client for at least 9 seconds [Link](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/replay-attack)
